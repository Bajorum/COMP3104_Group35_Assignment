DevOps is a set of practices that automates and integrates the processes between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

DevOps promotes Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), ensuring that new code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed to production.
This accelerates the release process and improves software quality by catching bugs early.
