Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices enable quicker release cycles, allowing teams to deliver features and fixes faster. This responsiveness helps meet user demands and stay competitive.

DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams. Breaking down silos leads to better communication and teamwork, which enhances productivity and morale.

Automation in testing and deployment reduces the risk of human error. Regular testing throughout the development process helps identify and fix issues earlier, leading to higher-quality software.
